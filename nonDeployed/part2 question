There are three sections in this part
1. Train a machine learning model (preferably with a neural network) that

2. Do a thorough analysis on the results and the dataset with visualizations (please feel free to add creative ways of visualization here).

3. Host/Deploy the results using any hosting service you want (streamlit/flask)
